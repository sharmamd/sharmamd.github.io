I am currently employed as a Project Associate at the Geophysical Inversion Lab, Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru, where my work revolves around big data seismology and imaging earthquake sources using symmetric autoencoder (SymAE). My primary interest lies in leveraging advanced technologies to understand complex earth mechanisms. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Physics (honors), with minors in Geology, Mathematics, and Computer Science from Banaras Hindu University. I later pursued and attained a Master's degree in Applied Geophysics from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

Besides my studies, I enjoy exploring different cultures, making friends, and learning new languages. Cooking is my passion, and I love trying to cooking dishes from all over the world. I'm especially skilled in North Indian cuisines.
