Welcome to my website! 
As a PhD student, my focus is on understanding the Adria plate margins using numerical techniques. I'll be working with various data sets and models to explore composition, temperature, and rheological conditions. My goal is to characterize these margins from the mantle to the surface, considering factors like subduction processes and their societal impacts such as seismicity and volcanism. Before this exciting journey, I served as a Research Fellow at the Geophysical Inversion Lab, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. There, my focus was on big data seismology and imaging earthquake sources using symmetric autoencoder (SymAE).

My passion for understanding complex earth mechanisms has been a driving force throughout my academic career. It all began with a Bachelor’s degree in Physics (honors), with minors in Geology, Mathematics, and Computer Science from Banaras Hindu University. Building on this foundation, I pursued and attained a Master’s degree in Applied Geophysics from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

Beyond the academic sphere, I'm an avid explorer of cultures, always eager to make new friends and learn new languages. Cooking serves as both a hobby and a passion for me—I relish the challenge of preparing dishes from diverse culinary traditions, with a particular knack for North Indian cuisines. Additionally, I'm excited to delve into Spanish dishes and broaden my culinary repertoire.
